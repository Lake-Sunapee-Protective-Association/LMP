## README 

This folder contains the raw, non-QAQC'd, non-collated LMP data from the LSPA. Please use the [primary files](https://github.com/Lake-Sunapee-Protective-Association/LMP/tree/main/primary%20files) instead of these. If you have any questions, please contact Bethel Steele (steeleb@caryinstitute.org) and Kathleen Weathers (weathersk@caryinstitute.org).

Folders labeled with years are LMP files.

'area lakes subset' are data from the LMP files that are attributed to the area lakes of the watershed and are not directly related to the LMP data for the streams or Lake Sunapee proper.

'ProDSS' folder contains raw ProDSS archives that didn't transfer to the LMP correctly in 2021.
