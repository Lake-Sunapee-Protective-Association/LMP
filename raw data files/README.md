This folder contains the raw, non-QAQC'd, non-collated LMP data from the LSPA. Please use the [primary files](https://github.com/Lake-Sunapee-Protective-Association/LMP/tree/main/primary%20files) instead of these. If you have any questions, please contact Bethel Steele (steeleb@caryinstitute.org) and Kathleen Weathers (weathersk@caryinstitute.org).
